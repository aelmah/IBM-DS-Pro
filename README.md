# IBM-Data-Science-Professional

**HOLAAAA!** Welcome to my repository for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate! This repository showcases my journey through the comprehensive data science specialization, offered by [IBM](https://www.ibm.com/fr-fr) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The program covers a wide range of topics, from the foundations of data science to more advanced concepts, including data analysis, machine learning, SQL, and data visualization.

Throughout the course, I completed various hands-on labs, quizzes, assignments, and case studies, allowing me to gain practical experience using tools such as [Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/), [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/), and SQL. This repository contains my project files, code, and relevant documentation demonstrating the skills and knowledge acquired during the certification process.

Feel free to explore the projects and insights I've gained during this learning experience!

## Program Overview 
The program is composed of 12 course series starting with basic concepts to more advanced skills, focusing on the essential tools and techniques used in the industry. The certification is self-paced and offered through Coursera, making it accessible to individuals worldwide who are interedted in a career in data science. 

## Learning Objectives 


## Course Structure
The courses followed a dynamic and well-balanced structure, utilizing multiple educational tools to reinforce both theoretical and practical understanding. The key components included:

  * **Video Lectures:**

The courses primarily consisted of video lessons presented by expert instructors. These videos explained core concepts in an engaging and accessible manner, breaking down complex topics into digestible pieces.
Each video was typically followed by a brief recap or summary to help reinforce key ideas before moving on to the next topic.

  * **Reading Materials:**

Complementing the video lectures, each course provided detailed reading materials. These readings offered in-depth explanations and examples that reinforced the content from the videos.
The reading sections often included links to additional resources, such as documentation, research papers, and case studies, to provide further insights into the subject.

  * **Assignments and Quizzes:**

Each course had multiple graded quizzes, usually after every module, testing your understanding of the material. These quizzes focused on core concepts and helped to reinforce the knowledge gained from the videos and readings.
In addition to quizzes, there were more comprehensive assignments that required applying the concepts learned in practical scenarios. These assignments allowed for hands-on practice and were sometimes peer-reviewed, adding an element of collaborative learning.

  * **Hands-On Labs (Tools, Plugins, and Applications):**

One of the standout elements of the courses was the hands-on labs, which allowed students to directly engage with real-world tools and environments. These labs provided an interactive learning experience that went beyond theory.

**Examples of hands-on labs included:**
* **Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab:** Interactive coding environments used to experiment with data science techniques, run Python code, and visualize results in real-time.
* **RStudio and GitHub:** These labs allowed students to work with tools commonly used in the industry. For example, using GitHub for version control and RStudio for statistical computing.
* **SQL for Data Science:** Practical labs focused on querying databases, creating and manipulating tables, running sub-queries, and using functions, all through an interactive platform that simulated real SQL environments.
IBM Watson Studio (in some courses): Labs sometimes integrated tools like IBM Watson to explore cloud-based machine learning and data science services.
* **Plugins and App Items:** The courses also offered plugins and app-based tools as part of their interactive learning environment. These tools allowed for direct interaction with the content in real-world-like settings.
For example, in some modules, you would access cloud-based platforms or run coding exercises through browser-based applications, providing a practical experience similar to what youâ€™d encounter in a professional setting.
* **Capstone Projects and Case Studies:** Many courses featured final projects or case studies, where you had to apply all the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the course. These projects often simulated real-world problems, providing a comprehensive exercise to bring all the elements together.
The case studies were particularly valuable as they were based on real-world data science applications, helping bridge the gap between academic learning and professional practice.
